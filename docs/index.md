# elm-tooling

[elm-tooling](./cli) is a CLI tool that manages your Elm tools. `elm-tooling init` creates `elm-tooling.json`, and `elm-tooling install` installs all tools specified in there in a fast and secure way. It’s a drop-in replacement for installing tools using `npm`.

[elm-tooling.json](./spec) is a file where Elm tools can put their configuration. This allows having configuration in one single place and reusing stuff between tools.

(“elm-tooling” is also the name of a GitHub organization ([github.com/elm-tooling](https://github.com/elm-tooling)) that includes the [Elm language server](https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server) and the `elm-tooling` CLI.)
